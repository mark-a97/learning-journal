				<h3><a id="week10"></a>Overall Summary </h3>
				<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-12-04"><strong>December 04, 2018</strong></time></p>
				<p>I learnt to:</p>
				<ol>
				
				</ol>
				<fieldset>
				<legend>Overall Summary</legend>
				In the first semester of university I feel like I have learned a lot in web development, but also still have more progress to make. I started with small amounts of experience with CSS and HTML, but now I have widened that knowledge and know a lot more. From creating lists, tables, and buttons, over to implementing grids, contact forms and responsive web pages. 
				<p>My most successful week I felt was creating the grid. Although I struggled because I didn’t understand it properly and struggled to make it work, when I finally understood and sorted the problems it felt like a big achievement. From this, I was then able to add the grid to another one of my pages and change it to how I wanted it to be. </p>
				<p>My most unsuccessful week was week 7 where I implemented flexible media into my web pages. Although it wasn’t that difficult, I had a few issues regarding the banner. Sometimes the banner was too big, or the margins weren’t correctly positioned and when the screen was made smaller the banner wouldn’t adjust. This took some time to fix, but as with everything it is always fixable if you put your mind to it and keep working on it. Another smaller issue I had here was converting the CSS I had in my HTML over to my CSS document.</p>
				<p>I still have much to learn regarding creating web pages, styling them, and in the design department of things. I have used some examples from other websites and referenced them in my journal as some parts of code such as the ‘Go to top’ button was a bit advanced for me to do off the top of my head, without any previous knowledge of this type of styling. I look forward to carrying on this progress</p>
				<p>I have also added some javascript to my web page. This is a change from the original button as it wasn't being as responsive as I wanted it to. I got this information from an online source which is referenced.</p>

				<h3><a id="week9"></a>Week 9 - HTML and CSS Forms</h3>
				<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-11-27"><strong>November 27, 2018</strong></time></p>
				<p>I learnt to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Insert a form into a web page</li>
					<li>Use different input types</li>
					<li>The use of fieldsets and legends </li>
					<li>How to include form validation</li>
					
				</ol>
				<fieldset>
				<legend>Week 9 Summary</legend>
				Week 9 I found particularly interesting apart from struggling with the slider which would just not seem to work. I believe now that to make it work I would need to include some JavaScript. The start of the form was just using the simple id attribute. Then it started to get interesting by adding the form elements such as labels, radio buttons, fieldsets etc. 
				<p>When adding the radio buttons, I wanted them to look slightly more modern and better looking, so I had looked up how to add radio buttons in my CSS. I have introduced code from an example and changed parts to fit on my contact page’s form.</p>
				<p> What I did find interesting this week, was the fieldset and legend elements. I do like the look of them and how they work so I have included them in my summaries throughout the learning journal. This is the same with the validation, which of course when making a form you are going to need. Using the ‘required’ attribute will stop users from missing out important fields of a form. </p>
				<p>I found the CSS styling quite easy compared to other weeks. It was what I have done before, just changing border styles, colours, widths etc. Not anything that required a struggle.</p>
				</fieldset>
				<h3><a id="week8"></a>Week 8 - CSS3 Responsive Layout</h3>
				<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-11-20"><strong>November 20, 2018</strong></time></p>
				<p>I learnt to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Use flexbox</li>
					<li>Use multi-columns</li>
					<li>Use more than one stylesheet</li>
				</ol>
				<fieldset>
				<legend>Week 8 Summary</legend>
				In week 8 I changed a lot on my web pages. At first, all the pages were all designed very similarly when you looked at them. They had the exact same grid, layout, font, headings etc. Consistency is good, but not when making step by step instructions. Here the card interface was introduced, along with a new stylesheet.
				<p>First of all, when I was trying to create the cards, I was still using the original stylesheet. This made this very difficult for me as it was not working as it was supposed to. After making a new stylesheet and linking it to the tutorial page, it started to come around and look a lot neater.  I had also been typing up the cards wrong in the html, which was causing them to appear wrong. Each time I were putting a new div called “instructions” after each card. This was putting the cards in a singular column, rather than setting them out how they appear now.</p>
				<p>That was all that really went wrong this week, and it took me a little while to figure out such a small mistake. But what went well was the styling of the cards, I found it very easy going back over the CSS and making sure I understood what was going on.</p>

				<h3><a id="week7"></a>Week 7 - Flexible Media</h3>
				<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-11-13"><strong>November 13, 2018</strong></time></p>
				<p>I learnt to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Insert flexible images</li>
					<li>Inserting flexible images with text wrapping</li>
					<li>Using a flexible video container</li>
					<li>Adding a banner into my web page</li>
					<li>Using background images</li>
				</ol>
				<fieldset>
				<legend> Week 7 Summary</legend>
				In week 7 there were a lot of changes that happened to my web page. This was mainly due to having it reviewed by the class. There were a few issues with my web page such as margins, padding, font types, styles, and text alignment. All these issues I quickly addressed, and it started to make my web page look better already.
				<p>There was also no way to tell which page I was on (learning journal, tutorial or contact me page). To fix this I looked up buttons and added in a box shadow, now it is clearer to the user to see what page they are on. My navigation bar was also not how I wanted it to be, I wanted the links to be separated across the page, rather than being clumped together. To fix this I used an element called “justify-content: space-between”. This separated out my navigation bar and made it look exactly how it wanted to look.</p>
				<p>Other than the review where my work was checked, during this week I a banner to one of my web pages (the tutorial page) and a background image to the rest. I didn’t add it to the learning journal or contact page because I didn’t see it necessary. I also added a flexible image which is kept at the very top of my web page, with some writing around it. I didn’t see a need to include an image in my journal so I have kept it there.</p>
				<p>I also found it bad practice to put CSS into my html files, so instead of doing that I converted it to my stylesheets.</p>
				</fieldset>
				<h3><a id="week6"></a>Week 6 - Responsive web page</h3>
				<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-11-06"><strong>November 06, 2018</strong></time></p>
				<p>I learnt to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Set up a grid using 3 coloumns on both desktop and mobile devices</li>
					<li>Hide elements that would be too big if the screen size is too small (the table)</li>
					<li>Organise the images via CSS</li>
					<li>I have understood the different parts of the grid such as the header, nav, table, main, aside and the footer</li>
					<li>Change and add code where necessary for the grid</li>
					<li>I am starting to feel my knowledge for CSS is increasing and that I have improved by playing around with the different elements</li>
				</ol>
				<fieldset>
				<legend>Week 6 Summary</legend>
				For me, week 6 was the most interesting as it is the first time in making a fully responsive web page. At the start, I was having a little bit of a problem with the grid, as I didn’t understand it fully until I went over the weekly tasks and read through it properly. I wasn’t putting some of the content in the right parts, so it made it a bit all over the place. What I thought was interesting is being able to hide certain elements within the CSS if the screen size were to be too small. I was very happy at the end of this being able to test my site on my phone and it is working without any problems. When I validated there were also no errors. </fieldset>
				<h3><a id="week5"></a>Week 5 - CSS advanced styling</h3>
				<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-10-30"><strong>October 30, 2018</strong></time></p>
				<p>I learnt to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Create space between text using CSS</li>
					<li>Use a dropcap class to give my learning journal a article look</li>
					<li>Make my text work around an image instead of having it above or underneeth/above</li>
					<li>Use 'float' to make my text either go to the left or right of the screen/image</li>
				</ol>
				<fieldset>
				<legend>Week 5 Summary</legend>
				During week 5 I found it interesting learning about dropcaps. Although I haven’t used any in my learning journal thus far I did learn how to use them. If I were to write an article I would use one in my web pages. Week 5 for me I was starting to get used to CSS again, I learned how to enable text to work around the image rather than just sit above or below it. This made it more professional and gave it a more stylish look. 
				<p>I am happy at the stage and progress of my website so far, I feel like everything is going well and I am progressing at a good rate. Along every week I have been checking both my html and CSS in the W3C validator, I have had some minor issues along the way but none that are difficult to fix.</p>
				</fieldset>
				<h3><a id="week4"></a>Week 4 - CSS basics</h3>
				<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-10-23"><strong>October 23, 2018</strong></time></p>
				<p> I learnt to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Add and link css to my html</li>
					<li>Change the font, size and colour of specific parts using css</li>
					<li>Style other elements such as headings, tables, lists etc.</li>
					<li>Style the default page elements by editing the #wrapper in css</li>
					<li>Use the class selector. Here I have used it on multiple occasions to seperate different parts of the site</li>
					<li>Use and edit buttons, now I can use a bigger variety</li>
					<li>Use CSS more rather than having it in the html. In this case I removed the table from my HTML and put it in my CSS</li>
				</ol>
				<fieldset>
				<legend>Week 4 Summary</legend>
				Week 4 for me was again more of a refresher week as I had not done any CSS for quite some time. I could recognise what was happening and understand the elements being used but was just not up to date. Therefore, making small changes to parts like the font and colours were very helpful. Shortly after getting used to this I’d go over the classes and understand what was being changed. In college, I was always told it was wrong or a bad habit to include CSS in your html, so where applicable I changed my html so that it was strictly html in there. 
				<p>I had used buttons before but never went through the different effects, so I looked this up and changed the navigation bar buttons and the button where it sends you to the top of the page. With my table, I felt like it looked a little untidy having the same colour throughout, so I changed it to where if part of the table is empty, it will change to a different colour. Although I said previously about having some CSS in my html there were some parts that I left out, so when I validated it I had a couple of errors. It was another simple fix where I just needed to change both my html and CSS.<p>

				<h3><a id="week3"></a>Week 3 - Lists and tables</h3>
				<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-10-18"><strong>October 18, 2018</strong></time></p>

			<p>In the first 3 lab tutorials I learned some of the most frequently used HTML tags and how to use them to structure text in a web page.</p>
			<fieldset>
			<legend>Week 3 Summary</legend>
			Week 3 was more interesting for me as it was the start of it becoming more interesting and enabling me to learn more rather than just recapping what I had previously done. In week 3 I had made a list within a list, started to create a table and put a link within an image. There was one part of this week that went wrong and that was to do with the image. 
			<p>I hadn’t set the location path correctly, so it was not showing what I wanted. I only had the name “html.png” - this would have only loaded the image if I were to put it in the main directory. To fix this problem I either had to move the image location or to change the code in my html. As I have an image folder it would make more sense and make it tidier to leave the image where it is and change my html to “images/html.png”, after this small change it worked as intended. </p>

			<h3><a id="week2"></a>Week 2 - Learning tags</h3>
			<p>Published on <time datetime="2018-10-11"><strong>October 11, 2018</strong></time></p>
			<p>I learnt to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Include dates and the use of -strong-</li>
				<li>Setting up a link to send an email to me</li>
				<li>Adding an image</li>
				<li>Making links to jump to the top and the bottom of the web page</li>
			</ol>
			<fieldset>
			<legend> Week 2 Summary</legend>
			For week 2 it was similar apart from including a link to send an email directly to myself. Although it is something small it was still interesting to learn something new very early on. So far I only had one problem with the validator but that was mainly because I forgot to add the slash at the end of a tag, which is a very small mistake and a simple fix.

			In this tutorial I learned how to do the following things -</p>
			<p>I learnt to -</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Set up a folder for my website on my Web (W:) workspace</li>
				<li>Link two pages together with a navigation menu using a relative link</li>
